# nand2coq


The goal of this project is to build an educational formally verified version of the Nand 2 Tetris course using Coq (and other formal tools).

https://www.nand2tetris.org/

https://www.coursera.org/learn/build-a-computer

In the course, a computer is built from the ground up, starting from Nand gates, abstracting to larger digital circuits, a CPU, Assembly, a stack based virtual machine, and finally a high level Java-like language.

This project ideally would become a baby DeepSpec.

It would be super cool to actually run this on an FPGA. The open source FPGA world is blowing up

Seems like a good tutorial getting started with open source FPGA
